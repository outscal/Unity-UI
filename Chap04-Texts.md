## Texts

   Great!!! 😎😎 you are halfway to completing your Unity UI course. Let's proceed to the next topic!!!

-   Every game has a name which is displayed in the UI and for displaying those names we use UI Texts.
-   Texts are non – interactable they’re used for displaying some information. For eg: it can be used to display instructions or it can be used to display a player’s current score in the game.
-   To insert a Text, right click in the Scene Hierarchy and go to Create → UI → Text.
