## Slider

-   The Slider UI element is commonly used where a certain value should be set between a minimum and      maximum value pair.
-   One of the most common usages of this is for audio volume, screen brightness, or for doing zoom.
-   To create a slider UI, right-click on the scene hierarchy and select Game Object -> UI -> Slider. A new slider element will display on your scene.
