## Slider
    - The Slider UI element is commonly used where a certain value should be set between a minimum and maximum value pair.
    - One of the most common usages of this is for audio volume, screen brightness, or for doing zoom.
    - To create a slider UI, right-click on the scene hierarchy and select Game Object -> UI -> Slider. A new slider element will display on your scene.
