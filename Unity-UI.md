- What is a UI???
    
    UI or User Interface is something which allows the User to interact with or to be specific with game development it is something that allows a Player to interact with. Unity UI is a UI toolkit for developing user interfaces for games and applications.

- Above snapshots show images of Main Menus of games. These main menus are the best examples of UI used in games. Obviously any game will have a menu. When we press on the buttons say single player or exit button then it will either start the game or exit the game by the functionality that has been assigned to the button itself.
- Some of the main components of UI are:
    - Canvas
    - Buttons
    - Texts
    - Panel
    - Slider
