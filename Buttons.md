## Buttons
    - Anything when clicked and performs an action after it has been clicked is called a button. In real life we have a switch/button to turn the light on/off in the same we have UI buttons for certain operations.
    - In game development we can consider a mouse button which when clicked during a game might fire a weapon or do any other operation assigned to it depending upon the game.
    - To insert a button, right click in the Scene Hierarchy and go to Create → UI → Button. If you do not have an existing Canvas and an Event System, Unity will automatically create one for you, and place the button inside the Canvas
